# 🧠 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) — TensorFlow/Keras Implementation

A simple and modular **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
This project demonstrates how to combine a **generator** and **discriminator** into a unified model that allows the generator to improve based on the discriminator’s feedback — the core concept of adversarial learning.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Modular GAN builder function (`build_gan`)
- ✅ Compatible with **Keras Sequential** and **Functional** APIs
- ✅ Uses **Binary Crossentropy** loss and **Adam optimizer (0.0002, 0.5)**
- ✅ Ready-to-train architecture — plug in your generator and discriminator
- ✅ Clean, commented, and beginner-friendly code

## 🧰 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
  https://github.com/xyedasadkazmi/Generating-Synthetic-QR-Codes-with-the-Trained_Generator.git
   
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Dependencies include:**
   - `tensorflow>=2.8`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib` (for visualization)

## ⚙️ Usage
```python
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras import Model, Input
from build_gan import build_gan
from generator import build_generator
from discriminator import build_discriminator

# Define latent dimension
z_dim = 100

# Initialize models
generator = build_generator(z_dim)
discriminator = build_discriminator()

# Build combined GAN
gan = build_gan(generator, discriminator, z_dim)

# Display architecture
gan.summary()
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The **generator** takes a random noise vector and produces a fake image.  
2. The **discriminator** evaluates both real and fake images, outputting probabilities.  
3. The **GAN model** freezes the discriminator and updates only the generator’s weights — so it learns to produce more realistic images over time.

---

## 📈 Example Training Loop
```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Train discriminator on real + fake data
    # Train generator through GAN
    # Monitor loss and accuracy
    pass
```
*(See `train_gan.ipynb` for a full working example.)*
